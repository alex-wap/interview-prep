# Interview Prep

## Framework for Solving Problems

1. Write down your input and output for the problem
  * What is your input?
  * What is your output?
2. Clarify assumptions
  * "I assume this is allowed"
  * "I assume this is happening"
3. Consider edge cases (this buys you time):
  * empty
  * one element
  * two elements
  * negative index
  * correct loops
  * null input?
  * unexpected input?
4. Choose a data structure to solve the program (confirm with your interviewer):
  *

* early termination
* edge case test

edit multiple lines (mac: option command up+down, w: control+alt up or down)
