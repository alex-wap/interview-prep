## Framework for Solving Problems

1. Write down your input and output for the problem
  * What is your input?
  * What is your output?
2. Clarify assumptions
  * "I assume this is allowed"
  * "I assume this is happening"
3. Consider edge cases (this gives you extra time to decide your approach):
  * empty
  * one element
  * two elements
  * negative index
  * correct loops
  * null input?
  * unexpected input?
4. Choose a data structure to solve the program (confirm with your interviewer):
  * Linked List
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Tree
  * Binary Tree
  * Binary Search Tree
  * Trie
  * Heap
  * Hash Map
  * Graph
5. Psudeo code
  * List out edge cases on the side
6. Write code
  * Plan for early termination (in if statement)
7. Test code (for general and edge cases)
