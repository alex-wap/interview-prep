# romanNumerals

## Prompt

1. Given a string that represents a Roman Numeral, output the numeric value as an integer. 
2. Solve this using two different methods.
3. Talk about time and space complexity of each method.
4. Code up one solution.

## Methods

1. Hashmap
2. Helper Function + Subtraction

## Time Complexity
1. O(n)
2. O(n)

## Space Complexity
1. O(n)
2. O(n)

## Notes

* iterate backwards
* if current is less than previous, subtract
* if current is greater than previous, add
