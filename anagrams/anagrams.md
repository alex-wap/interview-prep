# Anagrams

## Prompt

1. Given two strings, determine if the words are anagrams. 
2. Solve this using five different methods.
3. Talk about time and space complexity of each method.
4. Code up one solution.

## Methods

1. Sort both strings and check using array
2. Hashmap
3. 
4. Deletion sort?
5. Recurisve permutations to match first string

## Time Complexity
1. Time to quick sort: O(n*log(n)) + Time to traverse: O(n) => Final complexity: O(n*log(n))
2. O(n)

## Space Complexity
1. O(2n) => O(n)
2. O(n)
